Sea Ice Thickness Data Analysis (2010â€“2020)

Overview
Processed and visualized Southern Hemisphere sea ice thickness trends (2010â€“2020) using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Data sourced from ESAâ€™s CRYOSAT Climate Change Initiative.

Outputs:

Monthly & annual sea ice thickness trends

Key Steps

Data Acquisition â€“ Downloaded CRYOSAT NetCDF data (2010â€“2020).

Preprocessing â€“ Cleaned missing values, standardized timestamps, extracted thickness variables.

Analysis â€“ Computed monthly & yearly averages, tracked interannual variations.

Visualization â€“ Created plots and animations showing temporal patterns and anomalies.

Results

114 NetCDF files analyzed

Mean thickness: 1.6 m, total: 270,872 m

Seasonal pattern: Peaks in October (winter), lows in March (summer)

2020 anomaly: Incomplete dataset with inflated values
